        <h1>Introduction of C++</h1>
        <div class="text">
          <p> C++ is one of the most flexible and efficient general-purpose programming languages, which is a superset of
            C programming language <br>
            where most tools and libraries supported in C could be used in C++ as well. This introduction to the c++
            article is divided into several sections starting from a general overview of the language to its advantages
            and disadvantages.</p> 
        </div>
        <h1>Overview of C++</h1>
        <div class="text">
           <p> The advent of C++ happened in 1983 when Bjarne Stroustrup started working with ‘C with classes, which later
            got renamed to C++ that had few additional features like operator overloading, BCPL style comments, etc.
            The idea behind C++ is that it is a compiled language which means the source program is compiled to produce
            object files that yield an executable program after getting combined by a linker. The image below gives an
            idea of a program compilation in C++.
            <img src="compiler.png" class ="img-responsive" alt="loading">
            <br>
            One of the other aspects of C++ is its statistically typed feature, i.e. any object, value, or name should
            be pre-informed to the compiler, which could help to determine the set of operations that need to be
            performed. C++ is suited for applications that have resource constraints, and it benefits those who prefer
            writing quality code. Despite the introduction of several new programming languages, C++ is still evolving
            and is used by people from various backgrounds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="datatypes">
            <h1>Introduction to C++ Data Types</h1>
           <p> The following article provides an outline for C++ Data Types. In this article, we will look at different
            data types such as integer, float, double, char, or built-in data types like union, enum, struct, and data
            types like functions, pointers, arrays. Data types should be defined before the execution as it informs the
            compiler of the type of data specific variables holds. Integer data type can hold only integer values, it
            cannot hold the float values or string values. <br>
            A data type is to let know the variable, what type of element it is and definitely going to determine the
            memory allocation of that variable. We are aware that each data type has a different memory allocation.
            There are three different C++ data types namely; Primitive, Derived, and User Defined.</p>
            <h2>1. Primitive Data Types</h2>
           <p> These are pre-defined in c++, also called the built-in data types. We can directly use them to declare the
            variables. <br>
           a. Integer: Usually defined by “int”. We can know the size of memory allocated.</p>
            <h2>2. Derived Data Types</h2>
           <p> These are the data types that are derived from the primitive data types; which in turn justifies its name. <br>
            a. Array: Here, we define a series.</p>
            <h2>2. Derived Data Types</h2>
           <p> As the name already suggests, these are the data types which the user can define. <br>
            a. Structures: Storing the combination of either similar or different data types under continuous memory
            locations. As we already saw, in arrays we can store only items with similar data types. But structures can
            store different data types.</p>
